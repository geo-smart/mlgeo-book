    "Automated workflow for hyper-parameter tuning and optimal model finder\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will try some cool technique that has been used widely to make AI/ML less tedious and boost your ML workflow efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have learned [3.6](3.6_randomForest_regression.ipynb), you might be amazed but also annoyed by all those parameter tuning efforts and many back-n-forth iterations needed to figure out which configuration will be optimal for your case. It has been known as the major reason for low productivity in the AI/ML world. People come up with an idea that it seems most work in that tuning and iteration are very simple, can we automate it? The answer is yes, and that will be the technique we will introduce here: AutoML.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many AutoML solutions on the market, e.g., AutoKeras, auto-sklearn, H2O, Auto-WEKA, etc. Here we will focus on [PyCaret](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/installation) which is a popular one in both academia and industry and very easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tutorial, we will use the Pycaret Docker Image to run the tutorial. In Terminal, call ``docker`` to pull the PyCaret image and start a jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker pull pycaret/full\n",
    "docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -e GRANT_SUDO=yes pycaret/full\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Installations on M1 Mac can be tricky - especially when using lighgbm library. Try to install both libraries.\n",

You need to look at the RMSE and R2 columns in the comparison table, and the best RMSE and R2 are both achieved by Random Forest, which is much clear and can save you a lot of time to compare them. These results are professionally calculated at the point where PyCaret thinks it is neither overfitting nor underfitting. So the comparison results are very solid and reliable.\n",
