# 6.2 Geoweaver

After burying your head into the AI/ML experiments for several months/years, you might suddenly feel overwhelmed by remembering all those experiment details and results, especially the AI/ML configuration and their corresponding input data preparation steps. You are not alone, and many students spend hours and hours on experimenting but didn't get anything productive from their invested efforts. AI is complicated, and producing a usable AI model need long-term efforts and maybe multi-team/multi-organization collaboration. A good management tool is very much needed to manage everything for better reproducibility and replicability, and prevent numerous students and researchers from just throwing their previous efforts into the thin air. Geoweaver is one of such tools that help. 

Geoweaver is an open source workflow management tool to boost AI/ML research productivity by making full-stack AI workflow FAIRable. FAIR, short for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, represents the principles that are acknowledged by science community to define good data or source code sharing practices.
