# Use Cases in MLGEO


GEO-SMART project created a collection of JupyterBooks for [use cases](https://geo-smart.github.io/scm_geosmart_use_case/intro.html).

We also list below examples of final projects in the class.

* **Seasonal Ice Velocity Prediction** from Claire Jensen (UW):
    * Time series forecast of glacier surface velocities in the Greenland IceSheet. Time series were extracted from NASA with pixel tracking along flow lines from upstream, midstream, downstream of the XX glacier. Each time series were treated independently. Various deep learning models were explored: LSTM, CNN, FCNN, and transformers (chronos and moirai).

    * [Report](https://github.com/cjense/seasonal-icevelocity-prediction/blob/main/report%20and%20presentation/ESS_569_Final_Report.pdf) (version tag  1cc81dd)
