# 1.3 Jupyter Environment

## Jupyter Notebooks

<!-- **How to explain what your code is doing?** -->

Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project that aims to support interactive computing for data science and scientific computing. The project supports over 100 programming languages.

A Jupyter **notebook** allows you to merge text (written in Markdown, see below), images, HTML, LateX, code, and code output. It is a JSON file. The notebook is composed of *cells* that can be either code or text. 

A Jupyter **kernel** is programming language-specific process that executes the code contained in a Jupyter notebook. 

The **cells** can be run one by one. Or use the top-down menu from *Run* -> *run all cells* or *Kernel* -> *Restart Kernel and Run All Cells*

## Jupyter Lab
Jupyter Lab is an expanded version of the browser interface that includes **notebooks**, terminal, files (CSV, JSON etc), images, and other.

## Jupyter Hub
Is a Jupyter Lab launched by a given hardware/computer. Users may see where the computer is located in the browser address. The user may not know the type of hardware used. One exception is the selection of types of instances in public clouds.

## Markdown

### What is Markdown?
A simple language for text formatting.

Used for:
* Text in Jupyter notebooks
* Text on .md files on GitHub (e.g. README.md in a GitHub repo)
* Text on RStudio files

### Basic Markdown commands

Headings <br>

\# Heading level 1 <br>
\#\# Heading level 2 <br>
\#\#\# Heading level 3 <br>


Paragraphs: Leave a blank line

This is my first paragraph.

This is my second paragraph.
***


Bold text<br>

\*\*This is my bold text\*\*
***

Italic Text<br>

\*This is my italic text\*
***

Bold and italic text

\*\*\*This is my bold, italic text\*\*\*
***

Scratched text

LateX in the code cells

      \sqrt{x}

May give us this $\sqrt{x}$.
