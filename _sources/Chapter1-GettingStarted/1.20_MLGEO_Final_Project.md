### Final Integrated Project in Machine Learning in Geoscience

**Objective**: Integrate the learning of the entire class into a single, group project that demonstrates understanding and skill to manipulate data and develop machine learning approaches to a scientific problem. Evaluate the integration of AI-ready data preparation, classical machine learning (CML), and deep learning (DL) components into a cohesive project, with a focus on scientific discussion, interpretation, reproducibility, and team contributions.

### **1. Report (5 Pages) - 40%**

- **Content & Research Quality (25%)**  Quality, depth, and relevance of the research
    - Present a clear statement of an outstanding research question and place it in the context of an up-to-date literature review
    - Demonstrates the originality of the research
    - Present an AI-ready data set, preliminary analysis with correlation or description of basic data feature, and discuss potential data imbalance within the context of the stated problem.
    - Demonstrate strong understanding of classic machine learning and/or deep learning with an example 
    - Discuss the performance evaluation in the context of training the model and for generalization beyond the data and domain presented in the report.
    - Discuss the computational time for training and deploying
    - Discuss the appropriateness of computational resources needed


- **Structure and Organization (15%)** Coherence, clarity, and flow of the report
    - Logical structure:
        - Introduction with scientific background to motivate the project and the state of the data (e.g., we are missing the measurements X and propose to predict it from Y),
        - Data: what is a data sample, what are the features, what are the dimensions, EDA, if the problem is time series forecasting, how do you organize the data for training by splitting shorter time series into long time series, train-validation-test split and some discussion on whether in-domain vs out-of-domain the test data is.
        - Models: design, training strategies (e.g., for deep learning, give optimizer, learning rate, batch size, show learning curve),
        - Generalization statement: discuss the test performance and whether the generalization
        - Results: how is it doing and what do you think you can learn from it? how does the training take, how long does it take to infer/predict? How do you see this analysis contributing to a big data mining project?
        - conclusions and outlook, 
        - references.
    - Well-organized paragraphs with transitions between ideas
    - Key points and arguments are clearly presented and easy to follow
    - Figures presented have captions and clear labels and are references in the text.
- **Clarity and Writing Style (20%)** Quality & Effectiveness in Writing
    - Clear concise language
    - Minimal grammar or spelling errors
    - Professional and academic tone appropriate for the field

- **Critical Thinking & Analysis (20%)** Depth of analysis and reflection on the research topic
    - The analysis goes beyond simple description and shows depths of thought: address the questions:
        - what have you learned from this?
        - what are the advantages and limitations of your approaches?
        - critically, what do you think the ML methods can contribute to the over all research? 
    - Acknowledges alternative perspectives or potential limitations in the research
    - Demonstrates original thinking and critical engagement with the research

- **Formatting & Citations (10%)** Adherence to format guidelines and proper citation of sources
    - Follows formatting requirements (e.g., margins, font, length)
    - Correct use of citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago)
    - Correctly state the authorâ€™s CredIT (every student enrolled needs to be associated with a contribution and the CreDIT statement will assert that)
