### Final Integrated Project in Machine Learning in Geoscience

**Objective**: Integrate the learning of the entire class into a single, group project that demonstrates understanding and skill to manipulate data and develop machine learning approaches to a scientific problem. Evaluate the integration of AI-ready data preparation, classical machine learning (CML), and deep learning (DL) components into a cohesive project, with a focus on scientific discussion, interpretation, reproducibility, and team contributions.
