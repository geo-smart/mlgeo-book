# Chapter Overview

## Chapter 2: Data Manipulation

This chapter covers the essential skills for manipulating geoscientific data in machine learning. It covers a wide range of topics, from data definition, modalities, formats (including cloud optimized), best standard for preparing AI-ready data sets. The chapter also covers basic skills for data manpilulation, such as stastical assessments, data transforms (Fourier, wavelets), creating synthetic signals, feature engineering, and the foundamental concept of data dimensions.
