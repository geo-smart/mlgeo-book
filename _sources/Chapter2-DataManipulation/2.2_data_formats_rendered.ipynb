    "## 2. Hierarchical formats: NETCDF4 & HDF5\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical data formats are designed to store large amount of data into a single file. They mimic a file system (e.g., tree-like data structure with nested directories) into a single file.  There are two dominent hierarchical data formats (HDF5 and NETCDF4), and one emerging for cloud (Zarr). Hierarchical formats in general can store many data types (numeric vs string).\n",
    "\n",
    "## HDF5\n",
    "The Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5), is an open-source file format that supports large, complex, heterogeneous data. HDF5 uses a \"file directory\" like structure that allows you to organize data within the file in many different structured ways, as you might do with files on your computer. The HDF5 format also allows for embedding of metadata making it _self-describing_.\n",
    "HDF5 files are self describing - this means that all elements (the file itself, groups and datasets) can have associated metadata that describes the information contained within the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF Structure Example:\n",
    "- Datasets, which are typed multidimensional arrays\n",
    "- Groups, which are container structures that can hold datasets and other groups\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hdf5_structure4.jpeg\" alt=\"An illustration of a H5 data set \" />\n",
    "Figure: HDF5 data example. Found in [neonscience](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/about-hdf5)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Netcdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The network Common Data Form, or **netCDF**, was created in the early 1990s, and set out to solve some of the challenges in working with N-dimensional arrays. Netcdf is a collection of self-describing, machine-independent binary data formats and software tools that facilitate the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data stored in N-dimensional arrays, along with metadata describing the contents of each array. Netcdf was built by the climate science community at a time when regional climate models were beginning to produce larger and larger output files. NetCDF version 4 is now a subset of HDF5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling large arrays\n",
    "The NetCDF & H5 format has no limit on file sizes. However, any analysis tools that read data from a NetCDF array into memory for some computational operation will be limited by that particular machine's available memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### But slow at I/O\n",
    "When reading a hierarchical file, the whole tree of the data structure is scanned from the root node down. Since it has to be done each time a user makes an inquiry, reading H5 and Netcdf is **slow**. There are faster\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
