    "\n",
    "If you have learned [3.6](3.6_randomForest_regression.ipynb), you might be amazed but also annoyed by all those parameter tuning efforts and many back-n-forth iterations needed to figure out which configuration will be optimal for your case. It has been known as the major reason for low productivity in the AI/ML world. People come up with an idea that it seems most work in that tuning and iteration are very simple, can we automate it? The answer is yes, and that will be the technique we will introduce here: AutoML.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many AutoML solutions on the market, e.g., AutoKeras, auto-sklearn, H2O, Auto-WEKA, etc. Here we will focus on [PyCaret](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/installation) which is a popular one in both academia and industry and very easy to use.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the following tutorial, we will use the Pycaret Docker Image to run the tutorial. In Terminal, call ``docker`` to pull the PyCaret image and start a jupyter notebook:\n",
