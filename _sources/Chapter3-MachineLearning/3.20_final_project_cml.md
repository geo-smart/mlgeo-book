# **Final Project - Classic Machine Learning**

#### **Objective**
This assignment guides you through classic machine learning tasks for your AI-ready dataset. You’ll explore various ML algorithms, evaluate model performance, and assess computational efficiency. The goal is to practice the steps of selecting and optimizing a model for your project, preparing you for deeper model development.

#### **Structure of the Assignment**

1. **Research Project Relevance**
   - **Task**: Write a brief essay that discusses the relevance of machine learning to your project and outlines your approach.
   - **Requirements**:
     - A concise, ½-page essay (in `Research_Relevance.md`) that includes:
       - The problem’s connection to **classification** or **regression**.
       - Justification of whether the work will use a **supervised**, **unsupervised**, **self-supervised**, or **semi-supervised** approach.
       - Expected outcomes and potential impact of applying ML to your dataset.

2. **Clustering Analysis for Classification Projects**
   - **Task**: If your project involves classification, perform a clustering analysis on the features of your data, especially after dimensionality reduction.
   - **Requirements**:
     - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to understand feature clusters or patterns.
     - Conduct best practices for clustering analysis in a notebook (`notebooks/Clustering_Analysis.ipynb`):
       - Use **silhouette analysis** and **elbow curve** for optimal K identification.
       - Evaluate clusters with **homogeneity** or the **Fowlkes-Mallows Index**.
       - Test robustness using repeated runs of K-means with random seeds.
     - Visualize the clusters and discuss how this analysis informs your approach to classification.

3. **AutoML and Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Task**: Use automated machine learning tools or perform a manual model hyperparameter search to find suitable models and settings for your problem.
   - **Requirements**:
     - Apply **AutoML frameworks** (e.g., pycaret) or manual search techniques to test and select models.
     - Save results and key insights in a notebook (`notebooks/AutoML_Hyperparameter_Tuning.ipynb`).
     - Describe the algorithms evaluated and the hyperparameters optimized.
     - Identify the most promising models based on accuracy, interpretability, or computational cost.

4. **Training Engineering and Model Assessment**
   - **Task**: Perform a thorough analysis of training strategies and model assessment.
   - **Requirements**:
     - In a notebook (`notebooks/Model_Training_Assessment.ipynb`), demonstrate:
       - **Cross-validation** and **train-val-test splitting** practices to ensure robust evaluation.
       - Performance generality by testing on diverse subsets of the data.
       - **Bootstrapping** and **bagging** techniques across different model architectures and data variations.
       - Visualize model performance (e.g., learning curves, accuracy, loss) across training rounds.
       - A discussion of results, including how these methods affect model generality and performance.

5. **Computational Time Analysis**
   - **Task**: Analyze the computational time needed for model training and deployment.
   - **Requirements**:
     - In a notebook (`notebooks/Computational_Time_Analysis.ipynb`), include:
       - Metrics on training time for each model architecture, detailing how various parameters affect speed.
       - An exploration of time vs. accuracy trade-offs for different configurations.
       - An assessment of expected time requirements for model deployment in real-world scenarios.
     - Summarize findings in a short conclusion, focusing on any computational challenges or optimizations relevant to your model.
